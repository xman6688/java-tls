In most cases, we use a keystore and a truststore when our application needs to communicate over SSL/TLS.

Usually, these are password-protected files that sit on the same file system as our running application. The default format used for these files was JKS until Java 8.

Since Java 9, the default keystore format is PKCS12. The biggest difference between JKS and PKCS12 is that JKS is a format specific to Java, while PKCS12 is a standardized and language-neutral way of storing encrypted private keys and certificates.








$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias [youralias] -keyalg RSA -keystore [/preferred/keystore/path]
Use an [alias] and [path] of your choice.


keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA



keytool -list -v
